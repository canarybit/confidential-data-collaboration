############################################ AMD MEMORY ENCRYPTION #####################################################

AMD memory encryption consists of two schemes, Secure Memory Encryption (SME) and Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV).
SME defines a simple and efficient architectural capability for main memory encryption. Meanwhile SEV integrates main 
memory encryption capabilities with the existing AMD-V virtualization architecture to support encrypted virtual machines.
SME uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 128-bit key to encrypt and decrypt data from CPU to DRAM or in reverse.
The key is managed by AMD Secure Processor (AMD-SP), a 32-bit microcontroller (ARM Cortex-A5) that functions as a dedicated
security subsystem integrated within the AMD SOC. SME use models consists of full memory encryption where all DRAM contents
are encrypted utilizing the random key and partial memory encryption by setting the header of host physical address in all
the nested page table entries corresponding to DRAM, so that the hypervisor(host) enables the encryption for the VM memory
only. Other version of SME is transparent SME (TSME) that encrypts all memory.

Meanwhile SEV enhances isolation through the use of cryptography, encrypting code and data and enables an entirely new 
security model where code be cryptographically protected from higher privileged code such as hypervisor. In addition, 
SEV provides additional assurances to help protect the guest virtual machine code and data from the attacker. However, 
SEV does not protect against denial-of-service attacks against the guest. SEV can be used to increase the level of
security in these IaaS clouds by providing better security isolation, rooted in the hardware itself. Technically, SEV is
an extension to the AMD-V architecture which supports running multiple VMs under the control of a hypervisor.Each VM as 
well as the hypervisor is associated with a tag, and consequently an associated encryption key. One of the key features
of SEV is that guest VMs are able to choose which data memory pages they would like to be private. A SEV firmware provides
a secure key management which key is signed by AMD to demonstrate that the platform is authentic AMD and also signed by 
the owner of the platform to show who administers and owns the machine to the owners of guests.

In conclusion, it can be inferred that SME allows for main memory encryption for an operating system or hypervisor. Meanwhile
SEV supports running encrypted guests that a hypervisor cannot directly access.
