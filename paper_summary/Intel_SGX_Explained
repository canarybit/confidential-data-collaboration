##################################################### INTEL SGX EXPLAINED ###############################################

An SGX-enabled processor protects the integrity, confidentiality and freshness of the computation inside an enclave by 
isolating the enclave's code and data from the outside environment, including the operating system and hypervisor. 
Security extensions to the Intel architecture, such as Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) and Software Guard Extensions 
(SGX), rely on the fact that the processor die includes the memory and I/O controller, and thus can prevent any device 
from accessing protected memory areas via Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfers. The computer powers up, reboots, or 
resumes from sleep in the  Security phase (SEC). In such a system, the SEC implementation is quite important to take the 
first steps in establishing the system's measurement, namely resetting the special register that stores the measurement 
result. Two different attacks such as physical and software attacks are mainly considered as models for SGX design.

Intel SGX relies on Software attestation which is a software running inside an isolated container established by trusted
hardware can ask the hardware to a small piece of attestation data, producing an attestation signature. The hardware 
manufacturer acts as a Certificate Authority (CA) and provisions each secure processor that it produces with a unique
attestation key, which is used to produce attestation signature. Without the requirement to undergo software attestation,
the computer owner can build any container without constraints, which would make it impossible to reason about the security
properties of the software inside the container. Intel's SGX leaves the system software in charge of setting up the page 
tables used by address translation, but instantiates access checks that prevent the system software from directly accessing
the isolated container's memory.

The enclaves' code and data is stored in Processor Reserved Mmeory (PRM). The contents of enclave and the associated data
structures are stored in the Enclave Page Cache (EPC), which is a subset of the PRM. In order to perform its security 
checks, SGX records some information about the system software's allocation decisions for each EPC page in the Enclave Page
Cache Map (EPCM). The life cycle of an SGX enclave starts from Creation, then Loading, and Initialization, lastly Teardown
Finally, the SGX design relies on symmetric key cryptography, to guarantee the confidentiality and integrityof the evicted 
EPC pages, and on nonces to guarantee the freshness of the pages brought back into the EPC.
