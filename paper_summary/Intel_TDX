############################################# INTEL TRUST DOMAIN EXTENSIONS #####################################

The Intel TDX is designed to isolate VMs from the Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) or hypervisor and any other non-Trusted-
Domain software from a broad range software. Intel TDX is built using combination of Intel Virtual Machine Extensions 
(VMX), Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extensions, multi key, total memory encryption (MKMTE), CPU attestes and software
module. The Intel TDX provides two different services : to guarantee memory and CPU state confidentiality, and to allow the 
owners and consumers of the service through a remote attestation on which they are relying to help secure their data. 
Furthermore, the Intel TDX is hosted in a reserved, memory space identified by Secure-Arbitration-Mode-range-register 
(SEAM-RR) that does not have any memory-access privileges to other protected, memory regions in the platform, including
SMM and SGX. Criptographically, Intel TDX uses AES ephemeral 128-bit for confidentiality and SHA-3 and MAC 28-bit for
integrity.

Principally, Intel TDX works to prevent the VMM from modifying the enumeration and information provided such as CPUID and
control registers when the VMM chooses to allow the Trusted Domain (TD) to use the feature. Therefore, Intel TDX is designed
to provide a TD the following capabilities : Memory Confidentiality and Integrity, Address-Translation Integrity, CPU-State
Confidentiality and Integrity, Secure Interrupt and Exception Delivery, and Remote Attestation. The attestation results can
provide : Data that associate with themselves, TD measurements provided by Intel-TDX module, details of additional unmeasured
state provided by Intel TDX module, SVNs of elements in TDX Trusted Computing Base (TCB) provided by CPU HW. The goal of 
Intel TDX is to use an Elliptic-Curve-Digital-Signature-Algorithm (ECDSA)-based, asymmetric-attestation key representing 
the Intel-TDX-TCB version in order to sign an assertion (a Quote) with the information listed on remote attestation.

The Intel-TDX architecture is designed to utilize an Intel-SGX enclave, called the TD-quoting enclave, to generate the 
remote attestation for a TD. To support attestation infrastructure for Intel TDX, Intel has built a general-certification 
infrastructure, built upon the Intel SGX Data Center Attestation Primitives, to help certify TD-quoting Enclaves with a 
certificate chain rooted to an Intel-issued certificate. In conclusion, Encryption and integrity protection of private-
memory access using a TD-private key is the goal. Physical-address-metadata table (PAMT) to help track page allocation, 
page initialization and TLB consistency. Remote attestation designed to provide evidence of TD executing on a genuine, 
Intel-TDX system and its TCB version.
