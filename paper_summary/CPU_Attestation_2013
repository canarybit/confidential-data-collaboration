############################ INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR CPU BASED ATTESTATION AND SEALING ##########################

To enable attestation and sealing, two instructions are used : EREPORT which provides an evidence structure that is 
cryptographically bound to the hardware for consumption by attestation verifiers and EGETKEY which provides enclave
software with access to the "Report" and "Seal" keys used in the attestation and sealing process. For each enclave,
Intel SGX provides two measurement registers : MRENCLAVE for enclave identity and MRSIGNER for authority identity over
the enclave. The final value of MRENCLAVE is a SHA-256 digest that identifies, criptographically, the code, data, and
stack placed inside the enclave. Meanwhile MRSIGNER or Sealing Identity includes sealing authority, product ID and 
version number. The hardware validates the signature on the certificate, using public key contained within, and then it
compares the value of the measured MRENCLAVE againsts the signed version.

Intra-Platform Enclave Attestation or local attestation is defined as the process by which one enclave attests its TCB
to another enclave on the same platform. It uses Intel SGX's EREPORT and EGETKEY instructions. EREPORT generates a 
cryptographic REPORT that binds MRENCLAVE to the target enclave's REPORT KEY. Meanwhile, EGETKEY provides the REPORT KEY
to verify the REPORT. It starts from verifying enclave which sends its MRENCLAVE to reporting enclave. Then, reporting
enclave creates a cryptographic REPORT that includes its MRENCLAVE. Verifying enclave obtains its REPORT KEY and verifies 
authenticity of the REPORT. Local attestation scheme uses Symmetric - CPU REPORT KEY.

Inter-Platform Enclave Attestation or remote attestation is defined as the process by which one enclave attests its TCB 
to another entity outside of the platform. Intel SGX Extends Local attestation by allowing a Quoting Enclave (QE) to use 
Intel EPID to create a QUOTE out of a REPORT. EPID is a group signature scheme. It starts from verifying enclave becomes
the Quoting Enclave. After verifying the REPORT, the QE signs the REPORT with the EPID private key and converts it into a
QUOTE. Remote platform verifies the QUOTE with the EPID public key and verifies MRENCLAVE against the expected value. 
Remote attestation scheme uses Asymmetric-Intel EPID.
