########################## ENCLAVEDB : A SECURE DATABASE USING SGX #####################################

EnclaveDB ensures high level security such as confidentiality, integrity and freshness by placing sensitive
data(tables, indexes, and metadata) in enclaves protected by trusted hardware such as Intel SGX. A protoype 
of EnclaveDB built in this paper is Hekaton, SQL Server's in-memory database engine. As a threat model, this
project considers a strong adversary that controls the entire software stack on the database server, except 
the code inside enclaves. The implementation of EnclaveDB uses AES-GCM, a high-performance authenticated 
encryption with associated data (AEAD). Right now, EnclaveDB does not support queries both for public and 
secret data. The architecture of EnclaveDB consists of Trusted Kernel that provides management of enclave 
memory and enclave threads, Query Compliation and Loading, transaction processing by firstly creating a secure
channel between client and EnclaveDB, and Key Management to establish authentication process between client
and EnclaveDB.

EnclaveDB provides log that can support operations for appending log records, truncating the log and iterating
over the log. Due to this, Hekaton truncates the log at a carefully selected index to avoid data loss. To
ensure integrity and freshness of the log, a new and efficient protocol is designed for EnclaveDB based on 
following observaitons : correctness of database recovery and Hekaton can ensure state continuity. As parameter
whether the log records are success, several claims are checked at the end such as checkpoint continuity, 
continuity, integrity and liveness. This project implements EnclaveDB using an in-house SGX SDK and Intel SGX
PSW v1.1.28151. As evaluation parameters, performance model is set up and the overhead of running a set of
micro-benchmarks using SGX enclaves is measured. Those microbenchmarks consist of a simple key value store 
and a set of machine learning applications. Compared to an industry strength in-memory database engine and 
by using standard database benchmarks, a performance model that simulates large enclaves show that 
EnclaveDB achieves strong security with low overhead up to 40%.
