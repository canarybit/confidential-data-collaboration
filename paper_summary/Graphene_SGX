################ GRAPHENE-SGX : A PRACTICAL LIBRARY OS FOR UNMODIFIED APPLICATIONS ON SGX ###############

Graphene-SGX is an open source library OS that can execute unmodified applications on SGX by providing
dynamically-loaded libraries and secure multi-process support. Compared to previous libraries such as
Panoply, Graphene-SGX is actually 5-10% faster. The goal of Graphene is to bring-up rich applications 
on SGX quickly and then let developers optimize code or reduce the trusted computing base (TCB) as needed.
SGX in general protects the applications from three different attacks such as in-process attacks from
outside of the enclave, attacks from OS or hypervisor, and attacks from off-chip hardware. One of the
advantages given by SGX is application partitioning into multiple enclaves reduces the complexity and can be
good for security. Furthermore, Graphene-SGX provides a user-policy configuration based on manifest that does
not allow a program to access any resources which not declared in the manifest. To protect the application 
from the host file system, the manifest can specify secure hashes (using SHA-256) of trusted files. Graphene-
SGX also provides multi-processing abstractions such as fork that can create a second enclave and copies
the parent enclave's contents to reduce the overhead while doing only in a single enclave. As part of initialization,
the parent and child will exchange a session key using Diffie-Hellman. The enclave includes an OS shield, 
a library OS, libc, and other user binaries. To secure the enclave from malicious attacks, an enclave must 
be shielded. However to shield the enclave, it must carefully define the expected behavior of the untrusted 
system. Due to this, there are several aspects should be carefully defined such as file authentication, 
memory mappings, threading and exception handling. 

In evaluation section, several applications such as server (Lighttpd, Apache, and NGINX) and Command Line 
applications (R, GCC and CURL) are tested and performance includes latency and throughput are measured.
As baseline for comparison, both linux processes and Graphene on a linux host without SGX are used. In terms
of Trusted Computing Base (TCB) size and shielded functionality, Graphene-SGX is 44% smaller than SCONE. 
In a few cases, Graphene-SGX overheads are higher due to internal library OS or fundamental to enclave limitations.
Furthermore, denial of service, side channels, and controlled channel attacks are beyond the scope of Graphene-SGX.
Currently, Graphene-SGX does not support two optional kernel extensions such as the one that creates a reference
monitor to protect the host kernel from the library OS and the one that optimizes fork.
