###################### CLOUD COMPUTING FOR THE POWER GRID: FROM SERVICE COMPOSITION TO ASSURED CLOUDS ##################

As cloud technology has been adopted by many business providers such as bank industry, there is also possibility to bring
the electric power industry to use services offered by the cloud technology. There are two reasons that make the electric
power industry is avoiding to use cloud technology for its business: it does not offer any significant benefit compared to
dedicated computing infrastructures, or because with today's cloud technology the risks by far outweigh the benefits. Moving
power applications to the cloud will be beneficial since cloud technology provides several services such as: Time-varying
computational needs, reliable data storage, ease of access, and open market of utility-oriented computing services.

The migration of power system applications to the cloud would require stringent security guarantees such as confidentiality
and privacy, integrity, availability and legal compliance. To address the security compliances, two solutions are offered:
composing assured services and assured cloud computing. By using composing assured services scenario, the necessary 
confidentiality and privacy protection could be achieved using encryption technique. One of the encryption technique is
using homomorphic encryption techniques. However, these techniques are limited in the types of computation that they 
can support, and those that could compute arbitrary functions impose significant computational overhead and are far from
practical. By using assured cloud computing, confidentiality and integrity of communications to and from the cloud can be
ensured by standard cryptographic protocols (e.g. TLS and IPsec), strong guarantees of isolation between tenant VMs are 
needed. If both techniques are put all together, a bit set of assured cloud computing services will be used to compose
secure and available applications.

The question is still whether the security requirements can be addressed at a complexity and cost that do not outweigh the
benefits of moving to clouds. But as the cloud computing paradigm takes off it is conceivable that hardware tailored for
multi-tenacy with certain built-in protections will become available paving the way for assured cloud computing that can 
support power grid applications at a reasonable cost.
